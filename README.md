# Welcome To My GitHub! 

Just someone who really loves arts & crafts and then discovered the art of programming. All these repositories are either from university, youtube, websites or teachers. I started off with learning Python which then expanded to R before heading to uni. In uni, I got to expand more knowledge towards SQL, HTML, Javascript, statistics and many more. I am still discovering the many paths that I can take in the future, so right now, I shall just let my curious mind soar freely to discover many more wonderful things. As you can probably see from my repo, it is somewhat of a mess right now but it does somewhat reflect on how I am, always curious to learn all kinds of things. May the future me fill up this repo with many more wonderful ones, maybe even some projects that I will be satisfied with.
